Now try a repeating-key XOR cipher. E.g. it should take a string âhello worldâ and, given the key is âkeyâ, xor the first letter âhâ with âkâ, then xor âeâ with âeâ, then âlâ with âyâ, and then xor next char âlâ with âkâ again, then âoâ with âeâ and so on. You may use an index of coincidence, Hamming distance, Kasiski examination, statistical tests or whatever method you feel would show the best result.
